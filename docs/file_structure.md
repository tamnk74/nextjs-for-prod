### Grouping files by feature in a project organizes all related components, reducers, and tests together, making it easier to manage and modify each feature. It has the following benefits:

* Scalability: Large applications are easier to scale and maintain because each feature acts like a mini-application. You avoid scrolling up and down in your file list to find all the files you need.
* Collaboration: Developers can focus on specific features without disrupting othersâ€™ work.
* Onboarding: New developers understand the project structure faster, as all files for a feature are in one place.
* Refactoring: Updating a feature is streamlined since all its elements are grouped together.
* Modularity: Features can be reused, shared, or turned into standalone packages more easily.
* Micro-frontends: If your application ever grows to 30 or more engineers, it is easy to refactor to micro-frontends.
